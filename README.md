# El Switcher - Backend

Switcher is a real-time multiplayer board game where players have to form figures moving the pieces, according to their movement cards. Each player will have a deck with figures to discard as they form on the board, and the first to finish will be the winner. It is the web version of a real board game called [**El Switcher**](https://maldon.com.ar/blog/projects/el-switcher/).
